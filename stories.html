    <p>
      I am deeply sorry to hear of Bill’s passing, a loss that we in the nephrology and transplant communities all share with you.

      I was a former trainee under Bill from 1995-1998. He was my teacher and mentor. After that he was my collaborator and friend for another 18 years. He could inspire loyalty like few could. Many of his past trainees count him as perhaps the single most important professional influence in our lives. Bill was incredibly intelligent and tremendously hardworking, plus a fiery champion for children, all with a uniquely poignant sense of humor.

        The attached photo
      </a>
      is from a pediatric nephrology fellows’ graduation in 1997. All of his former fellows such as myself (on right in photo) had tremendous admiration for Bill’s towering intellect. We would try to “pick his brain” at every attempt. As shown in this photo, sometimes we went to great lengths to extract some of that brain power. My colleague fellow Stu Goldstein is holding a drill to Bill’s head for this purpose. Bill was a great sport to allow and participate in such a photo.

      How sad I am to offer you my deepest sympathy. However, there are so many great memories of growing up with Bill and staying in touch with him over these 65 years, that I hope that sharing some of these with you will bring some new fond memories of Bill.

      Bill and I met in the third grade at St. Raphael’s in Bay Village and remained life-long friends until our last exchange of texts in March. We were daily playmates, teammates, and classmates; Bill, quarterbacking our football team, playing guard on our basketball team where he gashed his head in St. Raphael’s gym, running on our 400 meter relay team, and catching on our school and Bay Village baseball teams, where he devised a signal to the pitcher when Bill didn’t like the umpire’s call ( he’d signal for a high fastball, duck as it was thrown, and see if the ump was quick enough to dodge it ).
    </p>

    <p>
      To get to St. Ignatius high school- 13 miles to downtown Cleveland- a "gang of 5” of us from Bay hitchhiked (!!), carpooled with parents, and eventually drove ourselves to and from the 13 miles for those 4 years. Bill and I were homeroom classmates and had nightly phone calls to talk about homework, classmates, teachers, movies, top 40 music, and cars (notice absence of reference to the opposite sex). Just hanging out at one of our 5 homes was our version of Netflix and Chill. Often, if we opted for a weekend movie, Bill’s dad would drive four or five of us to or from or both ways. He had an company radio car and would periodically radio call the office to test the strength and clarity of the voice transmission. At Bill’s homes, I recall 3 different ones in Bay Village, his dad had wired each one with total house stereo. So, we’d sit around his kitchen in each one and play cards and listen to the stereo. We were wild and crazy guys !

    <p>
      When the time came for college, Bill, Tom Comerford and I spent endless hours hitchhiking (again??!!) or driving the 550 miles from  Bay to Holy Cross where Bill and I were in several classes together. Bill was a waiter in the Dining Hall and academically really began to stand out his first two years there. But, as you may know, he decided to skip the next two years at Holy Cross and opted for the "AP curriculum at the Jesuit Sem “.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later, when he decided to return to Bay Village, he visited with my father who, I think, helped him land a position in a Renal Research Lab…and the rest is history.
    </p>

    <p>
      These great memories now fill my mind, recalling his humor, his wit, his insights, his piercing intelligence, his perseverance ( I remember trying to talk with him on the first day he got his first I-Phone and the calls kept dropping- whew )… but most of all his wholesome companionship over these 65 years.

      Dear Diane, Beth, Michael and Ian,
    </p>

    <hr class="space-32">

    <p>
      The website looks perfect. I hope that you've found some comfort in the stories people have shared there and on Facebook. Dr. Harmon was the best of the best.
    </p>

      Our patients love him and always trusted him. So many have reached out to us in the last few days to tell us how much they appreciated his wisdom, guidance and humor.
    </p>

    <hr class="space-32">

    <p>
      And we loved working with him.  He truly made us the Team we are today - I hope that we can continue to make him proud.

As happy as nephrology made him, it was always clear that sailing and you, his family, were his greatest loves.  Honestly, knowing hims love and dedication to kidneys and patients, that says a lot!

      I am saddened by this news. My condolences to the family and friends who will miss him deeply.

      I first met Bill at the Switchboard/Paging office at Children’s Hospital.  He burst into the office complaining bitterly about being paged in error.  We had the first of our long conversations that would more aptly be described as arguments.   These enjoyable arguments led to changes in his contact info along with changes to the on call schedules for Nephrology and the Organ Bank.
    </p>

    <hr class="space-32">

    <p>
      I sensed early on that Bill enjoyed a good argument and I was happy to be able to get my point of view into the conversation.  Bill also stopped me in the hallways or in the cafeteria to chat about anything or nothing.   I will truly miss him.

      Dearest Harmon family,
    </p>

    <hr class="space-32">

    <p>
      I would like to send you a card.  I was a child life specialist that worked with Dr Harmon for 7 years, who felt his strong support and gentle, kind, clear guidance while working with the dialysis and renal transplant teams.  I attended the Christmas party in your home and remember this feeling of sweet generosity from your family and how proud Dr. Harmon looked that evening.
    </p>

    <hr class="space-32">

    <p>
      I am very saddened to hear of his passing. Now living in Colorado and a clinical social worker ( I think he would have approved), I will not be able to attend the services and will hold you in my heart.
    </p>

    <hr class="space-32">

    <p>
      One of my biggest compliments as a child life specialist was from Dr. Harmon.  I had witnessed him telling another respected physician that I ..."was very good" at what I did...I felt so proud to be seen by him in this way and felt he trusted me.
    </p>
