      I am saddened by this news. My condolences to the family and friends who will miss him deeply.

      I first met Bill at the Switchboard/Paging office at Childrenâ€™s Hospital.  He burst into the office complaining bitterly about being paged in error.  We had the first of our long conversations that would more aptly be described as arguments.   These enjoyable arguments led to changes in his contact info along with changes to the on call schedules for Nephrology and the Organ Bank.

      I sensed early on that Bill enjoyed a good argument and I was happy to be able to get my point of view into the conversation.  Bill also stopped me in the hallways or in the cafeteria to chat about anything or nothing.   I will truly miss him.

      Dearest Harmon family,
    </p>

      I would like to send you a card.  I was a child life specialist that worked with Dr Harmon for 7 years, who felt his strong support and gentle, kind, clear guidance while working with the dialysis and renal transplant teams.  I attended the Christmas party in your home and remember this feeling of sweet generosity from your family and how proud Dr. Harmon looked that evening.

      I am very saddened to hear of his passing. Now living in Colorado and a clinical social worker ( I think he would have approved), I will not be able to attend the services and will hold you in my heart.

      One of my biggest compliments as a child life specialist was from Dr. Harmon.  I had witnessed him telling another respected physician that I ..."was very good" at what I did...I felt so proud to be seen by him in this way and felt he trusted me.
