  One night a few years ago I was flicking channels on the television when I saw a man who I thought I knew.  It turned out to be Bill who was the doc in charge on
  <a href="https://youtu.be/3J45blMNGpI?t=27m25s">Boston Med, Episode 7</a>.
  A 4 year child had been flown in with blood on her brain and, of course, he and his team saved her life.  When I saw Bill I mentioned to him how impressed I was that he saved that child's life.  Bill simply and humbly stated "that's what we do."  If I live to be 100, I will never forget Bill and his humble words on that day.
