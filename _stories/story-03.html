  Dear Diane, Beth, Michael and Ian,

  The website looks perfect. I hope that you've found some comfort in the stories people have shared there and on Facebook. Dr. Harmon was the best of the best.

  Our patients love him and always trusted him. So many have reached out to us in the last few days to tell us how much they appreciated his wisdom, guidance and humor.

  And we loved working with him.  He truly made us the Team we are today - I hope that we can continue to make him proud.

As happy as nephrology made him, it was always clear that sailing and you, his family, were his greatest loves.  Honestly, knowing hims love and dedication to kidneys and patients, that says a lot!
