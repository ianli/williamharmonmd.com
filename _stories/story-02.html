  I am saddened by this news. My condolences to the family and friends who will miss him deeply.

  I first met Bill at the Switchboard/Paging office at Childrenâ€™s Hospital.  He burst into the office complaining bitterly about being paged in error.  We had the first of our long conversations that would more aptly be described as arguments.   These enjoyable arguments led to changes in his contact info along with changes to the on call schedules for Nephrology and the Organ Bank.

  I sensed early on that Bill enjoyed a good argument and I was happy to be able to get my point of view into the conversation.  Bill also stopped me in the hallways or in the cafeteria to chat about anything or nothing.   I will truly miss him.
