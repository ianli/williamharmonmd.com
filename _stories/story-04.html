  How sad I am to offer you my deepest sympathy. However, there are so many great memories of growing up with Bill and staying in touch with him over these 65 years, that I hope that sharing some of these with you will bring some new fond memories of Bill.

  Bill and I met in the third grade at St. Raphael’s in Bay Village and remained life-long friends until our last exchange of texts in March. We were daily playmates, teammates, and classmates; Bill, quarterbacking our football team, playing guard on our basketball team where he gashed his head in St. Raphael’s gym, running on our 400 meter relay team, and catching on our school and Bay Village baseball teams, where he devised a signal to the pitcher when Bill didn’t like the umpire’s call ( he’d signal for a high fastball, duck as it was thrown, and see if the ump was quick enough to dodge it ).

  To get to St. Ignatius high school- 13 miles to downtown Cleveland- a "gang of 5” of us from Bay hitchhiked (!!), carpooled with parents, and eventually drove ourselves to and from the 13 miles for those 4 years. Bill and I were homeroom classmates and had nightly phone calls to talk about homework, classmates, teachers, movies, top 40 music, and cars (notice absence of reference to the opposite sex). Just hanging out at one of our 5 homes was our version of Netflix and Chill. Often, if we opted for a weekend movie, Bill’s dad would drive four or five of us to or from or both ways. He had an company radio car and would periodically radio call the office to test the strength and clarity of the voice transmission. At Bill’s homes, I recall 3 different ones in Bay Village, his dad had wired each one with total house stereo. So, we’d sit around his kitchen in each one and play cards and listen to the stereo. We were wild and crazy guys !

  When the time came for college, Bill, Tom Comerford and I spent endless hours hitchhiking (again??!!) or driving the 550 miles from  Bay to Holy Cross where Bill and I were in several classes together. Bill was a waiter in the Dining Hall and academically really began to stand out his first two years there. But, as you may know, he decided to skip the next two years at Holy Cross and opted for the "AP curriculum at the Jesuit Sem “.

  Later, when he decided to return to Bay Village, he visited with my father who, I think, helped him land a position in a Renal Research Lab…and the rest is history.

  These great memories now fill my mind, recalling his humor, his wit, his insights, his piercing intelligence, his perseverance ( I remember trying to talk with him on the first day he got his first I-Phone and the calls kept dropping- whew )… but most of all his wholesome companionship over these 65 years.
