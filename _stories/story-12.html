  Hi Beth,
</p>

<hr class="space-32">

<p>
  Apologies for this crazy way of sending my sympathy, but I had to reach out. My 8 month old daughter, Julia, was a patient of your dad's. She has ESRD and we saw him many times when inpatient this past year. He was clearly so well respected by his patients and colleagues, and I could tell he was the one they turned to to discuss different treatments. I felt reassured that we were in the best hands when he walked into the room. He got a kick out of my daughter's Halloween costume- she was a two month old nurse- and I must say I had some satisfaction in making him laugh with it! He clearly had a great sense of humor, in addition to a brilliant mind. We are grateful to have known him. My sympathy to you and your family.
