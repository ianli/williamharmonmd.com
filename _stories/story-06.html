  What a sad event. Fred Lovejoy and I probably knew Bill the longest here. Fred was Chief Resident in 1971-72 and I arrived here from Boston City as a senior resident just as Bill Harmon was beginning his internship.

  We were on Team B, 1 intern from MGH, 2 from Children’s and I as senior resident. I think Alan Leichtner was in his HMS Peds 3rd-year clerkship or was doing a "Sub-I". There was no ICU yet. The other intern from Children's was a delightful but ineffectual Chinese man who Charlie Janeway  had invited to do research here. When he decided to stay in the USA, he had to do a minimal amount of clinical rotations. One problem: his spoken and receptive English was extremely poor. That never deterred Charlie Janeway in his attempt to improve international health care.

  Bill Harmon, who already had his full patient load, supervised every order that the other guy wrote in unintelligible text. Bill made me promise that if I was on with that guy, I would sleep on the floor. I would have been crazy not to. How prophetic that our sickest kid was a teen who had received immunosuppression for neophrotic syndrome and developed varicella pneumonia requiring intubation.

  I could ask anything of Bill, like "another intern's patient needs to be presented at 
  Chief's Rounds and he went home sick." Harmon would then present the case "cold" with all the labs in sequence from his memory from night coverage. There were no signout sheets then.

  Bill had no facial hair and he looked ~18 yrs old at the most as an intern. Parents would ask me if he was a medical student. I would counter that, if he was, he would already be the smartest house officer in the Dept of Medicine. And the best I have ever seen in my 45 years here.

  Over the years, especially when the Renal Div shared a Fegan floor with Endocrinology, Bill and I would reminisce about that rotation on Team B in '71-'72 and all the characters we shared as patients and fellow house officers and attending and some patients with living donor renal transplants working just fine after more than 15 years. There was no detail too unimportant in his patients--the same approach he took as an intern covering two patient loads in 1971-72.

  His memory is a blessing and an example. He set the bar for 45 years here.
