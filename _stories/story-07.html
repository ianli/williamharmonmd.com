  Hi,
</p>

<p>
  I'm not sure where these emails will go, to Dr. Harmon's family or hospital staff. Regardless, I felt this was the best way to share how much appreciation I have for Dr. Harmon, and I was never even his patient.

  My family met Dr. Harmon shortly after my sister Katelyn Colantonio was rushed to the hospital with a mystery illness. We had no idea what was going on and were terrified when doctors decided to biopsy her kidneys based on some blood test results, and found hematomas there instead, causing major blood loss and a diagnosis of kidney failure. We were horrified, confused, and worst of all: we had no idea what this meant, what was ahead, if my sister was dying or would ever lead a normal life. We were lost and terrified. Every day was worse than the day before as we slowly found out more about her condition.

  Dr. Harmon gave us steady, extremely well explained advice and information in a compassionate manner. While still being serious and straightforward, Katelyn understood clearly how much he cared for her (and for my whole family), how truly invested he was in her care in every stage of treatment: diagnosis, dialysis, transplant, post transplant. He took the time to know Katelyn well. He fine tuned her treatment plan at every step and never handled us a "one size fits all" way. He kept up with Katelyn after her transplant - remembered topics she loved to talk about, like cooking and musical theater, and was sure to ask her about her progress in school.

  In short, Dr. Harmon walked us through what was undoubtedly the hardest experience of our lives. Walking into a medical problem we knew nothing about, it was easy to trust him. He was clear, intelligent, and he really did care about us. I believe Katelyn's recovery would not have been as easy as it was if we had not been walked through the whole process by him. He gave us Katelyn's gift of life. We will never be able to thank him enough for this.

  Wishing you all deep sympathy. He'll be greatly missed by us.
