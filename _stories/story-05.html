  To the members of Bill’s family:

  I am deeply sorry to hear of Bill’s passing, a loss that we in the nephrology and transplant communities all share with you.

  I was a former trainee under Bill from 1995-1998. He was my teacher and mentor. After that he was my collaborator and friend for another 18 years. He could inspire loyalty like few could. Many of his past trainees count him as perhaps the single most important professional influence in our lives. Bill was incredibly intelligent and tremendously hardworking, plus a fiery champion for children, all with a uniquely poignant sense of humor.

    The attached photo

  is from a pediatric nephrology fellows’ graduation in 1997. All of his former fellows such as myself (on right in photo) had tremendous admiration for Bill’s towering intellect. We would try to “pick his brain” at every attempt. As shown in this photo, sometimes we went to great lengths to extract some of that brain power. My colleague fellow Stu Goldstein is holding a drill to Bill’s head for this purpose. Bill was a great sport to allow and participate in such a photo.
