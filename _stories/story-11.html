  Dearest Harmon family,
</p>

<p>
  We are deeply sorry to hear of Bill’s passing, a loss that we in the nephrology and transplant communities all share with you.

  We met with Professor Harmon in Shanghai 2005 and in Boston Children’s Hospital 2006. He has been supporting us since the very beginning of the dialysis and transplantation center in the Children’s Hospital of Fudan university. He inspired us all the way.

<p>
  Distinguished scholar, outstanding doctor, and a warm human being, William Harmon is mourned by the Chinese pediatric nephrologist community, and will be greatly missed by all who knew him.
