  Dear Diane, Beth and Michael,
</p>

<hr class="space-32">

<p>
  We are truly sorry for your loss.  Bill was a friend for 65 years.  We attended grade school, high school and college together.  Our “gang of five” had many great times.  There were many memorable touch football games over Thanksgiving breaks with my brother and his friends.  Bill spent two years in the Jesuits which deferred his completion of college at Holy Cross.
  Our education overlapped at Case Western Reserve Med School.  We were happy to have Bill as a groomsman at our wedding in 1969.  I am sorry that we drifted apart due to geography, post graduate training and military service.

  Taking care of sick children requires a special gift which Bill exemplified.
