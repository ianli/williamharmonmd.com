  Dearest Harmon family,
</p>

  I would like to send you a card.  I was a child life specialist that worked with Dr Harmon for 7 years, who felt his strong support and gentle, kind, clear guidance while working with the dialysis and renal transplant teams.  I attended the Christmas party in your home and remember this feeling of sweet generosity from your family and how proud Dr. Harmon looked that evening.

  I am very saddened to hear of his passing. Now living in Colorado and a clinical social worker ( I think he would have approved), I will not be able to attend the services and will hold you in my heart.

  One of my biggest compliments as a child life specialist was from Dr. Harmon.  I had witnessed him telling another respected physician that I ..."was very good" at what I did...I felt so proud to be seen by him in this way and felt he trusted me.
