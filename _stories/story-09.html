  Dearest Harmon family,

  I am deeply sorry for your loss. Dr. Harmon was truly one of a kind. He was a pioneer in medicine whose legacy is felt not only at Boston Children’s Hospital but throughout the world. Since hearing the news and reflecting back on my training under him, it’s humbling how every decision I make in my daily practice is influenced by his teachings or research in one way or another.

  What most people may not know about Dr. Harmon, unless they’ve spent some time with him, is how funny, down to earth, and sometimes even quirky he was. I still remember the first day I met him on my fellowship interview and sat in his office. From the Darth Vader mask proudly displayed in one corner, to the Arabian dagger framed on the wall, or his brand new (back then) state of the art Macbook air on his desk, there were so many random things we talked about like old friends even though I was only a wannabe nephrologist at the time and he was one of the world’s leading experts in the field. This was only the start of many more memorable times to come.

  I took the liberty of using one of his photos to create this attached montage that I think celebrates him as one of the great genius minds of this century. I think he would have liked it.
