  My deepest condolences to Dr. Harmon's family.  He was larger than life, and so many people throughout the years benefited from his tireless devotion to his patients and his field.  His legacy is carried on by so many of who trained under him.  We will continue to pass along the knowledge and spirit which he inspired.
