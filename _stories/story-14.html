  Dear Harmon family, we are writing to express our deepest sympathy for your loss. Our daughter Bella was a patient of Dr. Harmon’s and we will never forget the profound impact he made on her successful outcome and our entire family.

  In March 2014 we were told Bella had end stage kidney disease and would need a transplant. Until that moment Bella had been an active, athletic and healthy girl so the diagnosis was sudden and shocking. Because we live in southern Connecticut, we started Bella’s care close to home in New York. At the time we were also building a house in Kennebunkport and when we told our builder Geoff Bowley the news, he suggested we reach out to his former client, Bill Harmon at Boston Children’s Hospital.

  Having grown up in metro Boston, my husband and I were aware of Children’s reputation and eager to take Geoff Bowley’s referral and reach out to Dr. Harmon but we had to motivate Bella to travel to Boston to meet yet another doctor.  On that first visit, Bella was wearing a brand new pair of bright yellow sneakers and a Red Sox baseball cap. Her cheery attire was a stark contrast to her frightened and reluctant approach to the meeting. When Dr. Harmon walked into the examination room where we were all waiting, the very first thing he said was, “I bet you won’t get lost in the snow wearing those sneakers.”  She cracked a smile. He then engaged Bella in a spirited discussion about the Red Sox. It was only after this genuine, no-nonsense introduction that he began to speak to Bella about kidney disease. His decision to speak “to Bella” and his side door approach, signaled to her something was different here from the hospital in New York.

  Attached is a photo of Bella’s bright yellow sneakers which no longer fit her but which she has kept as a talisman. When we shared the sad news of Dr. Harmon’s passing with her, she went up to her room to find the sneakers and inscribed them with a message of gratitude to him. These sneakers are hanging from a flagpole outside our home in CT.

  My husband Bill was ultimately cleared to donate his kidney to Bella and the transplant surgery took place on July 24, 2014. Last summer we celebrated the 1-year anniversary at our home on Goose Rocks Beach and were hopeful that you and Dr. Harmon would join us. True to his reputation, we learned that Dr. Harmon worked late at the hospital that day and then with the traffic getting out of Boston, arrived in Kennebunkport too late to join our celebration. But that night we toasted Dr. Harmon and his entire team at Boston Children’s Hospital.

  As recently as a couple of months ago, we met with Dr. Harmon to discuss a major gift to support his immunosuppression research. It was Dr. Harmon’s singular expertise and express commitment to his patient’s long-term wellbeing that inspired us to explore such a relationship with BCH.  We intend to carry on in his honor and to that end have met with Dr. Hildebrand and Dr. Fleisher to discuss next steps. Once the terms of our gift are finalized we hope to be in touch with you to share the details.

  After reading the other stories on your website, we now understand Dr. Harmon’s love of sailing. I must say he was our anchor to windward in the stormiest of times and we will always remember him with great gratitude, respect and tenderness.
